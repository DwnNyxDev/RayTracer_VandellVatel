Raytracer Final Project for my AP CSA class.

How to Use:
1. Run jar file
2. Create whatever scenes you want using the gui I created.

Try:
- creating a sphere at 0,0,-15 with a radius of 2
- clicking that sphere and changing it's color
- giving the sphere a texture from the folder of Textures I included. 
(Remember to set the sphere's diffuse to a dark color to actually see the texture)
- Going to Scene->Load in the MenuBar and loading in the saved scene that I included.
(It'll take a second to load)
